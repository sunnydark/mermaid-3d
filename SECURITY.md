## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in mermaid-3d, please report it responsibly by emailing the maintainer directly rather than opening a public issue.

You can reach us by opening a **private security advisory** on GitHub:

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to release a fix promptly.
